# ImageToSketch
In this project, I try to convert images to sketches using the Facial Image dataset.
If you want to test out the sketch maker, you will need to make two folder in the same directory named TestImage and TestSketch. Put all your images in the TestImage Folder and the code should provide you with the sketches in the TestSketch folder. You may change the names of the folders by altering the code. 
I have used AutoEncoders for this.
After this, you simply need to run the SketchMaker.ipynb file to get the results.
